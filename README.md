# Secret-Knock
An algorithm that picks up a rhythm of signals (could be physical knocks using a microphone) and determines if they satisfy the code sequence.

/*  
 *   
 *  Knocking Sequence Enabled Action arduino program
 *  
 *  
 *  Created by Yorai Shaoul. The program is open source and can be used for
 *  personal applications. The use of this code for profit is prohibited
 *  unless otherwise specified by the creator.
 *  I can be reached at yorai[at]mit[dot]edu
 *  
 *  The physical setup required for this program to function is simple.
 *  It consists of a DIGITAL microphone or button, and some components
 *  that will do something once the correct rhythm of knocks is inputted.
 *  
 *  For this example, I used a button/microphone, a servo at pin 8, and
 *  several LEDs connected to the analog pins.
 *  
 *  
 *  Keep on making!
 *  Yorai :)
